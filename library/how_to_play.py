                                                        In a world where light is rare and dim,  
                                                        You are trapped within the maze/'s grim.  
                                                        A flickering lantern, your only friend,  
                                                            Illuminates the paths that bend.

                                                        Each step a test, each turn a dare,  
                                                         The shadows hide the maze's snare.  
                                                        An ancient place, with secrets deep,  
                                                          Where those who enter often weep.

                                                         Guardians of old, in darkness dwell,  
                                                         Their watchful eyes, a silent knell.  
                                                       Through twisting paths and unseen ways,  
                                                         The lurking monsters end their gaze.

                                                       Navigate the maze, with light so slight,  
                                                           Uncover paths, escape the night.  
                                                         With each new level, foes increase,  
                                                          Will you find the maze's peace?

                                                            Or lost within, forever roam,  
                                                          A wandering soul, without a home.  
                                                        Prepare yourself, the journey's near,  
                                                      Through the Blind Maze, conquer your fear.
